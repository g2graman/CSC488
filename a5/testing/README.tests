A5 Tests:
Passing: Pretty self explainitory, each folder contains one .488 file tests the respective code generation for the related specification for A5.
Failing: A few specific test cases for code generation failures

Old Tests: Tests from A1-3

IfStatements
1. If statements with a constant boolean
output: "Hello World!"
2. If-else statements with a constant boolean as conditional
output: "Hello World!This works!"
3. Nested if statements
output "Hello world! How are you?"
4. Nested if statement in the else clause
output "Hello world!"
5. Test that statements around the if statement blocks execute properly
output "Hello world! How are you? I hope this passes! Fingers crossed!"
6. Test boolean variable as the condition
output "Hello world!"
7. Test with anonymous function as the condition
output "Hey! Hello world!"

LoopStatements
1. Test a regular loop with exit statement, and regular loop with exit when statement
output: "Hey!" 5 times and "Hello!" 5 times
2. Test a while loop
output: "Hey!" 5 times
3. Test a while loop with an exit inside
output: "hey!" 3 times
4. Test a nested loop
output: helloheyheyheyhey 5 times

Function and Procedure Call statments
1. Test with function with one parameter
2. Test with function with multiple parameters
3. Test with procedure with parameters
4. Test with procedure with no parameters

AnonFunction
1. Test with integer
output: 3
2. Test with boolean
output: 0 123
3. Test nested anonymous functions
output: Hey! Hello World! 1
4. Calling a procedure from an anonymous function
output: Hey! Hello World!

GetStatement
1. Test one variable
2. Test with multiple variables

Expressions
1. Check all binary boolean expressions with constants
output: "Hello World!" five times
2. Check all binary boolean expressions with variables
output: prints numbers 1-16
3. Check all binary boolean expressions with functions
output: prints numbers 1-16
4. Check the definition of conditional and and OR
output: prints numbers 1 and 2
5. Test unary operators
    a: test negation
    output: 1-4
    b: test negation with boolean expressions
    output: 1-4
    c: test negation of boolean functions
    output: 1-4
    d: test negation of anonymous functions
    output: 1-5
6. Check all comparison expressions with constants
7. Check all comparison expressions with variables
8. Check all comparison expressions with functions
