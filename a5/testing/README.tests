A5 Tests:
Passing: Pretty self explainitory, each folder contains one .488 file tests the respective code generation for the related specification for A5.
Failing: A few specific test cases for code generation failures

Old Tests: Tests from A1-3

output: "Hello World!"
2. If-else statements with a constant boolean as conditional
output: "Hello World!This works!"
3. Nested if statements
output "Hello world! How are you?"
