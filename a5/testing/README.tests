A5 Tests:
Passing: Pretty self explainitory, each folder contains one .488 file tests the respective code generation for the related specification for A5.
Failing: A few specific test cases for code generation failures

Old Tests: Tests from A1-3

IfStatements
1. If statements with a constant boolean
output: "Hello World!"
2. If-else statements with a constant boolean as conditional
output: "Hello World!This works!"
3. Nested if statements
output "Hello world! How are you?"
4. Nested if statement in the else clause
output "Hello world!"
5. Test that statements around the if statement blocks execute properly
output "Hello world! How are you? I hope this passes! Fingers crossed!"
6. Test boolean variable as the condition
output "Hello world!"
7. Test with anonymous function as the condition
output "Hey! Hello world!"
